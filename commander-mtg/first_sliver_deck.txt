DECK STRATEGY:
--------------
This is an ultra-competitive 5-color Sliver tribal deck built with no budget constraints. The deck leverages The First Sliver's cascade ability to chain together multiple Sliver spells, creating explosive turns where each Sliver cascades into another.

KEY SYNERGIES:
- Manaweft Sliver + Gemhide Sliver turn all Slivers into mana dorks
- Sliver Legion makes your board exponentially powerful
- Shared Animosity = each attacking sliver deals damage equal to # of slivers (MASSIVE multiplayer damage)
- Fury Sliver gives the entire army double strike for lethal combat
- Cloudshredder Sliver gives FLYING + HASTE to entire army (attack immediately with evasion!)
- Venom Sliver gives deathtouch to all (every sliver trades favorably)
- Crystalline Sliver + Diffusion Sliver + Hibernation Sliver protect your board
- Root Sliver makes all Slivers uncounterable
- Thorncaster Sliver + wide board = massive damage
- Constricting Sliver provides repeatable removal
- Sliver Hivelord (indestructible) + Toxic Deluge = asymmetric board wipe
- Heroic Intervention + Akroma's Will provide premium combat tricks and protection
- Guardian Project draws a card for each sliver you cast (27 triggers!)
- Cascade chains with The First Sliver create massive value
- Free spells (Deflecting Swat, Flawless Maneuver, Pact of Negation) protect your board at critical moments
- Ancient Tomb accelerates early game development
- Urborg + Yavimaya make EVERY land tap for any color (perfect 5-color fixing!)

MANA BASE:
The mana base consists of the most expensive and competitive lands available:
- All 10 ABUR original dual lands ($4,000-$10,000+ each)
