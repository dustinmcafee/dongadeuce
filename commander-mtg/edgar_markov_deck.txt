DECK STRATEGY:
--------------
This is an ultra-competitive Mardu vampire tribal deck built with no budget constraints. Edgar Markov's eminence ability creates a 1/1 vampire token every time you cast a vampire spell, allowing you to build a massive army while never needing to cast your commander.

KEY SYNERGIES:
- Edgar Markov's eminence creates vampire tokens with every vampire cast (unstoppable engine!)
- Urza's Incubator reduces all vampire costs by 2 (explosive turns!)
- Black Market generates massive mana from vampires dying (exponential mana engine!)
- Shared Animosity makes each attacking vampire deal damage = # of vampires (exponential multiplayer damage!)
- Grave Pact + Dictate of Erebos force opponents to sacrifice when your vampires die (board control!)
- Cordial Vampire grows your entire vampire army when any vampire dies
- Blade of the Bloodchief grows vampires +2/+2 whenever a creature dies (exponential growth!)
- Phyrexian Reclamation recurs vampires from graveyard for value
- Captivating Vampire steals opponent's creatures when you have 5+ vampires
- Shadow Alley Denizen makes tokens unblockable (evasion!)
- Legion Lieutenant gives all vampires +1/+1 (tribal lord)
- Elenda, the Dusk Rose grows massive then creates huge vampire army on death
- Sanctum Seeker drains ALL opponents when vampires attack (massive lifegain/drain!)
- Champion of Dusk draws cards equal to # of vampires (card advantage engine)
- Stinging Study draws 6 cards for 4 mana (Edgar's CMC = 6!)
- Reconnaissance allows you to attack freely then untap before damage (broken combat trick!)
- Blood Artist + Kalastria Highborn + aristocrats drain opponents when vampires die
- Deadly Rollick is FREE removal when Edgar is on battlefield
- Toxic Deluge + Blasphemous Act + Austere Command clear boards while aristocrats trigger
- Asylum Visitor + Stromkirk Condemned create card advantage and madness synergies
- Cover of Darkness makes all vampires unblockable (closes games fast!)
- 9 premium ramp sources accelerate early development
- Erebos, God of the Dead provides card draw and shuts off opponent lifegain (devastating in multiplayer!)
- Make a Stand provides indestructible to all creatures and enchantments (board protection!)
- Vault of the Archangel gives entire army deathtouch + lifelink for combat domination
- Bojuka Bog provides graveyard hate on a land
- Chromatic Lantern fixes all colors perfectly
