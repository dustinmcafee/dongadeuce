## üî¥ ACTUALLY MISSING FEATURES

### 1. Game Log/History System ‚ùå

**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Status:** Not implemented

**Impact:**
Players cannot review past actions during complex turns or resolve disputes about game state.

**What's Needed:**
- GameEvent sealed class for all action types
- GameLog UI component with scrollable history
- Integration with all GameViewModel actions
- Timestamp and player color coding
- Auto-scroll to latest events

**Why Not Implemented:**
- Not critical for basic gameplay
- Can play complete games without it
- Nice-to-have for dispute resolution

---

### 2. Commander Tax Tracking ‚ùå

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 1 day
**Status:** Not implemented

**Impact:**
Players must manually track commander tax (additional {2} for each previous cast from command zone).

**What's Needed:**
- Add `timesCastFromCommandZone` field to CardInstance
- Display tax amount in command zone dialog
- Increment counter when casting from command zone
- Show total mana cost including tax

**Why Not Implemented:**

- Easy to add later

---

### 3. Network Multiplayer Backend ‚ùå

**Priority:** CRITICAL (for network play)
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Status:** UI exists, backend not implemented

**Impact:**
Cannot play games with remote players. Only hotseat mode works.

**What's Needed:**

#### GameServer.kt
- Ktor WebSocket server on configurable port
- Accept player connections
- Maintain connected players list
- Broadcast game state updates to all clients
- Handle player disconnects gracefully
- Validate game actions for cheating prevention

#### GameClient.kt
- Ktor WebSocket client
- Connect to host server by IP:port
- Send local player actions to server
- Receive and apply remote game state updates
- Reconnection logic for dropped connections
- Heartbeat/ping system

#### GameMessage.kt
- Serializable network protocol with kotlinx.serialization
- Message types for all game actions:
  - PlayerJoined, PlayerLeft, DeckLoaded
  - GameStarted, DrawCard, PlayCard, MoveCard
  - TapCard, UpdateLife, CommanderDamage
  - NextPhase, PassTurn, ChatMessage
  - CountersAdded, CardAttached, etc.

#### Integration
- MenuViewModel.startHosting() - Start server
- MenuViewModel.connectToGame() - Connect client
- GameViewModel - Broadcast all actions over network
- GameViewModel - Listen for and apply remote actions
- State synchronization and conflict resolution

**Why Not Implemented:**
- Large engineering effort (3-4 weeks)
- Hotseat mode fully functional as alternative
- Requires careful design of network protocol
- Must handle edge cases (disconnects, cheating, sync)

---

### 4. Token Creation ‚ùå

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Status:** Not implemented

**Impact:**
Cannot create tokens (treasure, food, clue, creature tokens, etc.). Must use placeholder cards or track manually.

**What's Needed:**

- Predefined common tokens (treasures, etc.)
- Custom token creator
- Token-specific context menu
- Track tokens separately from real cards

**Why Not Implemented:**

- Requires additional UI design

---

### 5. Copy/Clone Cards ‚ùå

**Priority:** LOW
**Effort:** 1-2 days

**Why Not Implemented:**
- Rare mechanic in Commander
- Manual workaround available
- Low priority

---

### 6. Keyboard Shortcuts ‚ùå

**Status:** Not implemented

**Impact:**

- Enter: Pass turn
- T: Tap selected card
- U: Untap all

- M: Mulligan
- 1-9: Select hand card

**Why Not Implemented:**

- Easy to add later

---

### 7. Settings/Preferences ‚ùå
