## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Library card ordering now consistent (last card = top of library, stack-based)
  - drawCard() now uses lastOrNull() instead of firstOrNull()
  - millCards() updated to use lastOrNull()
  - moveCardToTopOfLibrary() places card at end of library list
  - Establishes clear convention for library ordering across all operations
- **Critical:** Drawing from empty library now correctly causes player loss
  - Player.hasLost set to true when attempting to draw with no cards in library
  - Follows MTG rules for drawing from empty library
  - UI updates to show defeated player status
- **High:** Active player bounds checking added to prevent crashes
  - GameState.activePlayer now validates index before access
  - Throws descriptive IllegalStateException if out of bounds
  - Prevents application crashes on edge cases
- **High:** Life total changes now check for player loss (life <= 0)

  - Player.setLife() sets hasLost = true when new life <= 0
  - Player.gainLife() no longer needs loss checking
  - Follows MTG rules for life total loss condition
